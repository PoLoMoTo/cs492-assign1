The best for producer throughput is the first come first serve algorithm with many more producers than consumers. However, this comes at a large cost to the consumer throughput, turnaround times, and wait times.The best case for consumer throughput is the round-robin algorithm with many more consumers than producers and a large quantum. While the consumer throughput is throttled by the producer throughput, the large quantum allows certain products to last a while and therefore even out the throughputs. 

As for the wait and turnaround times, they are very reliant on the number of products being created. With smaller numbers of products, the average times are much lower since there is much less of a chance for an anomaly to occur. With larger amounts of products, the average times jump significantly since there is much more of a chance for very high or very low values to occur.
